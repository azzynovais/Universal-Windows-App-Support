## Universal Windows App Support
A ZorinOS-like GUI helper for managing Windows apps with Wine and Bottles as option and dependency


## How it works?
You have an bash file in this repository, download it, and make it executable, and then you ask if you want to install, or remove if you don't want
```chmod +x windows-app-support.sh```
```./windows-app-support.sh```

## After installed, what do I do?
Then you open any .exe or .msi file and use the "Windows App Support", and then you see if you use Bottles, or Wine, your call
